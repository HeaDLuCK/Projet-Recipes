    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Leftover cranberry sauce is obviously great on turkey sandwiches, and it's even delicious warmed up and spooned
        over ice cream or pancakes, but have you tried it in muffins? This easy recipe for cranberry muffins uses a cup
        of your smooth or chunky leftover cranberry sauce. The batter comes together in minutes and the moist, sweet
        muffins are perfect for a post-Thanksgiving breakfast or snack.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Two cups of all-purpose flour give these leftover cranberry sauce muffins structure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Use a combination of white and brown sugar for ultimate sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes the batter rise and
            creates a fluffy
            texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and flavorings</strong>: These cozy muffins are flavored with cinnamon, cardamom, a pinch of
            salt, and vanilla
            extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Leftover cranberry sauce</strong>: You can use homemade or store-bought cranberry sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Any milk you have on hand is fine, from regular whole milk to your favorite
            alternative milk. Some
            reviewers suggest substituting orange juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Vegetable oil adds moisture without imparting any flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: One whole egg adds structure, richness, and moisture.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Mix the wet ingredients</strong>: Beat the cranberry sauce, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla until
            well-combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: Mix the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl, then slowly
            incorporate the dry
            mixture into the wet mixture.</li>
        <li><strong> Bake the muffins</strong>: Pour the batter into lined muffin cups and bake in a preheated oven
            until the muffins are
            golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
